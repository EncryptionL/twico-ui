# Architecture

## Three things in one repo

1. **The npm package** (`twico-ui`) — the shipped library.
2. **The design system** — tokens, styles, guidelines, UI kits, and `*.card.html` preview cards.
3. **The documentation website** (`site/`) — a Vite + React app deployed to GitHub Pages.

Only `dist/` + `styles/` + `README.md` + `LICENSE` are published to npm (`files` in `package.json`).

## Component model

Each component is a self-contained React function:

- Imports only `react` (and `react-dom` for portals). **No other runtime dependencies.**
- Injects its own scoped CSS once, via a `<style>` element keyed by a unique id, inside a
  `useEffect`. The CSS string is a **constant** — never built from props.
- Styles everything through **CSS custom properties** (`--color-*`, `--radius-*`, `--space-*`,
  `--shadow-*`, `--ease-*`, `--font-*`). This is what makes the system themeable and dark-mode aware.
- Icons are **inline SVG**. Fonts are self-hosted. **No CDNs** (see [security.md](./security.md)).
- SSR-safe: no `window`/`document` at module or render scope.

**Foundational primitives.** Beyond UI components, the library ships **layout** (`Stack`, `Grid`,
`Container` — in `components/layout/`) and **typography** (`Heading`, `Text` — in
`components/typography/`) primitives: pure, token-styled wrappers for building layouts and text
without hand-rolled CSS. The documentation site is itself built from them (dogfooding).

The barrel `src/index.ts` re-exports the value and the types for every component. It must be kept
in sync when components are added or removed.

## Build pipeline

`npm run build` runs `tsup`:

1. **JS** — esbuild bundles `src/index.ts`, resolving each `../components/<dir>/<Name>` to its
   `.jsx`, emitting `dist/index.mjs` (ESM) and `dist/index.cjs` (CJS). `react`/`react-dom`/
   `react/jsx-runtime` stay external (peer deps).
2. **Types** — `rollup-plugin-dts` (via `dts: true`) resolves the same specifiers to the sibling
   `.d.ts` files and rolls them into `dist/index.d.ts`.
3. **`onSuccess`** runs `scripts/add-use-client.mjs`, which **prepends `"use client";`** to both JS
   bundles (a tsup `banner` is stripped by esbuild) and shifts the sourcemaps by one line. This is
   what lets the package import into a Next.js App Router Server Component. CI asserts line 1 of each
   bundle is `"use client"`.

### Package entry & resolution (JS + TS, ESM + CJS)

With `dts: true` + dual `format`, `tsup` emits `dist/index.d.cts` alongside `dist/index.d.ts`. The
`exports` map uses **per-condition `types`** so both module systems resolve the right declarations:

```jsonc
"exports": { ".": {
  "import":  { "types": "./dist/index.d.ts",  "default": "./dist/index.mjs" },
  "require": { "types": "./dist/index.d.cts", "default": "./dist/index.cjs" }
}}
```

So the package works identically from JavaScript (ESM **or** CommonJS) and TypeScript.
`npm run check:exports` (are-the-types-wrong) guards every resolution mode — `node10`,
`node16` CJS/ESM, and `bundler` — and runs in CI (the `styles.css` asset entry is excluded since
it carries no types).

## Styling / theming

- `styles.css` (dev entry) `@import`s `tokens/*` + `base.css`.
- `styles/twico-ui.css` is the **shippable** concatenation that consumers import as
  `twico-ui/styles.css`; its `@font-face` rules point to `./fonts/*.ttf` (self-hosted).
- **Dark mode** = `.dark` class on `<html>`; every `--color-*` token flips. Portaled overlays
  re-theme too because they read the same tokens.

## Docs site (dogfooding)

`site/` aliases `twico-ui` → `../src/index.ts` (Vite config), so the documentation renders the
real components from source. See [docs-site.md](./docs-site.md).
